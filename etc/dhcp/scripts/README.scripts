Please use this directory for on-commit scripts instead of `/etc/dhcp` to
make them work with the system selinux policy.

NOTE: To make dhcpd daemon able to execute the scripts /etc/dhcp directory
MUST be accessible by dhcpd group. Due to huge impact on dhclient users
it was not done during the installation so please adjust access rights accordingly

For example:
# chgrp dhcpd /etc/dhcp
